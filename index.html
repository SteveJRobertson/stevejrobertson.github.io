        <h1>Front-end web / UI developer</h1>

        <p>I am an experienced developer with a comprehensive understanding of web development
        technologies; from supporting legacy sites in older versions of Internet Explorer, to
        building responsive web apps in HTML5, Sass, AngularJS and Gulp.</p>

        <p>I'm currently mid-contract so I'm not looking for work at this moment. If you would like
        to get in touch about any potential opportunities, please contact me via Twitter or LinkedIn
        using the links below.</p>
